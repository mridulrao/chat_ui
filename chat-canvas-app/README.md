# ChatCanvas Refactor Summary

## Overview
The original `ChatCanvas.jsx` was a monolithic component (~400+ lines) handling multiple responsibilities. It has been refactored into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns.

## New File Structure

```
src/
├── ChatCanvas.jsx                 # Main component (entry point)
├── utils/
│   ├── constants.js              # Configuration constants
│   ├── utils.js                  # Basic utility functions
│   └── geometry.js               # Layout and positioning logic
├── hooks/
│   ├── useResizeObserver.js      # ResizeObserver management
│   └── useLayoutEngine.js        # Auto-placement and overlap resolution
└── components/
    ├── MessageBubble.jsx         # Individual message bubble
    ├── ReplyInput.jsx            # Reply input form
    └── ConnectionLines.jsx       # SVG connection lines
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Constants**: All magic numbers and configuration in one place
- **Utils**: Pure functions for calculations and transformations
- **Geometry**: Complex layout algorithms isolated
- **Hooks**: Stateful logic extracted into reusable hooks
- **Components**: UI elements as focused, reusable components

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Functions are pure where possible
- Dependencies are explicit through imports
- Easier to test individual modules

### 3. **Reusability**
- Layout algorithms can be used in other contexts
- Utility functions are generic
- Components can be easily styled or extended
- Hooks can be reused in different components

### 4. **Performance**
- ResizeObserver logic is isolated and optimized
- Layout calculations are separated from rendering
- Reduced component re-renders through better state management

## Module Responsibilities

### `utils/constants.js`
- Grid and spacing configuration
- Visual styling constants
- Derived calculations

### `utils/utils.js`
- Basic math utilities (clamp, snap, etc.)
- Message creation helpers
- Thread navigation functions
- Rect overlap detection

### `utils/geometry.js`
- Rectangle calculations and measurements
- Occupancy grid management
- Slot-finding algorithms (side, below)
- Placement strategy logic

### `hooks/useResizeObserver.js`
- ResizeObserver lifecycle management
- Bubble size tracking
- Cleanup on unmount

### `hooks/useLayoutEngine.js`
- Auto-placement algorithm
- Overlap detection and resolution
- Main thread vs side thread logic
- Grid snapping and constraints

### `components/MessageBubble.jsx`
- Individual bubble rendering
- Click and drag event handling
- Styling based on sender type

### `components/ReplyInput.jsx`
- Reply form positioning
- Input state management
- Form submission handling

### `components/ConnectionLines.jsx`
- SVG line generation
- Parent-child connection drawing
- Dynamic updates on layout changes

### `ChatCanvas.jsx` (Main)
- State coordination
- Event handling orchestration
- Component composition
- Viewport and stage management

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules
2. **Better Testing**: Each module can be unit tested independently
3. **Cleaner Code**: Each file focuses on one concern
4. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand modules incrementally
5. **Future Extensions**: New features can be added with minimal impact
6. **Performance Optimization**: Individual modules can be optimized separately

## Usage

The main `ChatCanvas.jsx` component remains the entry point and can be imported exactly as before:

```jsx
import ChatCanvas from './ChatCanvas.jsx';

function App() {
  return <ChatCanvas />;
}
```

All the internal complexity is now hidden behind clean module boundaries, making the codebase much more maintainable and extensible.
